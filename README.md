Disclaimer : this started as a fork of the [vaultctl](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/vaultctl)

Vault-sync is a command line utilty for provisioning a Hashicorp's [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io) from configuration files. Essentially it was written so we could source control our users, policies, backends and secrets, synchronize the vault against them and rebuild on-demand if required.

##### **Build**
---

 There is a Makefile in the root directory, so a simply `make` will build the project. Alternatively you can run the build inside a docker via `make docker-build`

##### **Usage**
---

An example for most supported configurations can be found in the `tests` directory.

To sync the directory you can run for instance :
`vault-sync -A https://vault.mydomain:8200 -t $VAULT_TOKEN sync --sync-full -c tests/config.yaml -p tests/policies`

This will sync all config from `tests/config.yaml` and all policies in `tests/policies` that are in format `*.hcl`

```shell

   --version, -v                     print the version
```

##### **Configuration**

The configuration files for vault-sync can be written in json or yml format *(note, it check the file extension to determine the format)*. You can specify multiple configuration files and or multiple directories containing config files.

###### - **Authentication**

Authentication backends can be created using the following

```YAML
auths:
- path: userpass
  type: userpass
- path: some/path/users
  type: userpass
- path: github
  type: github
  attributes:
  - uri: config
    organization: SomeOrganization
```

###### - **Users**

Users are place in a users: [] collection, the vault authentication type *(at present only userpass is supported, though it would be trivial to add more)* followed by the policies associated to the user

```YAML
users:
- userpass:
    username: rohithj
    password: password1
  policies:
    - common
    - platform_tls
```

###### - **Backends**

The backends are defined under the 'backends[]' collection, each backend must have a path *(i.e. a mount point)*, a type which is the Vault backend type, a description *(which is enforced)* and an optional collection of config items. Keeping it simple the config[] is essentially a series of PUT requests. You can grab the configuration options and the uri from the Vault documentation. Note. an extra option *'oneshot'* been added, it simply means the config option will ONLY is run the first time the backend is created, which is useful for some backends like PKI, transit etc.

```YAML
backends:
- type: transit
  path: platform/encode
  description: A transit backend used to encrypt configuration files
  attributes:
  - uri: keys/default
    oneshot: true
- type: generic
  path: platform/secrets
  description: platform secrets
- path: platform/platform_tls
  description: platform tls
  type: generic
- path: platform/pki
  type: pki
  description: Platform PKI backend
  attributes:
  - uri: root/generate/internal
    common_name: example.com
    ttl: 3h
    oneshot: true
  - uri: roles/example-dot-com
    allowed_domains: example.com
    allow_subdomains: true
    max_ttl: 1h
# one of the annoying things about the mysql backend is it attempts to connect to the db when
# adding the config/connection config??
- path: platform/db
  type: mysql
  description: Platform Database
  attributes:
  - uri: config/connection
    value: root:root@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/
    oneshot: true
  - uri: roles/readonly
    sql: CREATE USER '{{name}}'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '{{password}}';GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO '{{name}}'@'%'
```

###### - **Secrets**

```YAML
secrets:
  - path: platform/secrets/platform_tls
    values:
      hello: world
      rohith: yes
  - path: platform/secrets/se1
    values:
      hello: world
      rohith: yes
```

###### - **Example Output**

INFO[0001] -> synchronizing the secrets with vault, secrets: 0

```


#### **Transit Encryption**
---
The sub-command 'transit' permits you to encrypt and decrypt the file contents using a [Vault transit](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/transit/index.html) backend. The current use case being we hand off management to others to manage their our namespaces, secret, backends etc and behold a generic endpoint for encryption.

##### **TODO**
---

- More tests
- Keep up with Vault.
- Documentation
